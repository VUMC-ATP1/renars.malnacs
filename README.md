# Hi there!

I'm RenƒÅrs. Just a regular guy living in Riga, Latvia. I'm interested in everything technology related and have been working in IT field for a few years now. Previously I had more background in Web and graphic design, building websites on Wordpress platform etc. but decided to switch things up a bit and pursue a more technical career path. Nevertheless, previously gained knowledge and experience is still quite valuable for me and has been proven useful still.

Currently I'm working in online payment processing sector [at Worldline](https://worldline.com/). Supporting various applications and systems which ensure seamless online transaction processing. I also have quite a lot of experience in manual testing, test case writing etc. That's why I chose this course. I've seen quite a few cases from experience where testing processes are ineffective and could be improved by automation. But I just didn't know how to do it at that time :laughing: Really looking forward to this course to get new knowledge and practical experience.
